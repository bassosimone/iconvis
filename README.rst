ICONVIS
=======

ICONVIS (Interactive and Customizable ONtology-based VIsualization
System) is a Rich Internet Application that allows to display and
browse structured data in the form of an ontology. The ontology in
input to the system is designed based on the most significant values
of a data source, so it is a representation of the overall knowledge
of the data domain. Users can switch from the exploration of concepts
in the ontology graph to the effective fruition of contents of the
data source. In addition, ICONVIS is able to reach open datasets
on the Web (like DBpedia, Geonames, Freebase, etc.) in order to
increase information at runtime and to display it to users in a
suitable fashion.
